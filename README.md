💻 Big Integer Arithmetic Engine
This project implements a high-precision arithmetic engine in C capable of handling 1024-bit integers — far beyond the limits of standard int or long data types. The engine supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with accurate overflow detection and memory-safe operations.

✨ Features
📌 Supports 1024-bit Integers
Designed for mathematical operations on large numbers exceeding native data type limits.

➕ Addition & Subtraction
Handles signed/unsigned arithmetic with carry and borrow logic.

✖️ Multiplication
Efficient digit-by-digit multiplication with result normalization.

➗ Division
Performs long division and returns both quotient and remainder.

⚠️ Overflow Protection
Detects and handles overflow gracefully during operations.

🧠 Modular Structure
Code is organized using structures (struct) and dynamic memory (malloc, free) for scalability.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Language: C

Techniques: Dynamic Memory Allocation, Arrays, Bitwise Operations, Structures
